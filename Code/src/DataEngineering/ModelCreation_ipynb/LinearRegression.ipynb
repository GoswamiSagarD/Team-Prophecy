    "EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING PRIOR:\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model is going to be moving average prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For context, weighted projections is opposite to moving average prediction. Weighted projections looks at macro changes and scales it down to micro, and moving average prediction scales from micro to macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we hope to accomplish:\n",
    "- If the smaller model is expanding, the total data should be expanding.\n",
    "- Our dataset is small, but it can be divvied into different categories.\n",
    "- If you're looking at total enrollment, we are breaking down into smaller subsets like F1 visas, programs, etc. so that way we can see if the previous semester has X enrollments we can look at the next semester's Y enrollments and identify changes.\n",
    "- We would be not concerned with how dynamic these subsets are in a normal weighted projections.\n",
    "- In the moving average predictions, we are looking at those dynamic predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPY Polyfit regression has the highest possibility of fitting all of the data points because it can be linear or nonlinear, but only if we do regression for FALL and SPRING separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "WE WILL ONLY BE CONCERNED WITH F1 STUDENTS IN CORE CLASSES.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do NOT have a huge testing set, and it is better to completely overfit on the dataset rather than to underfit on 4 data points."
