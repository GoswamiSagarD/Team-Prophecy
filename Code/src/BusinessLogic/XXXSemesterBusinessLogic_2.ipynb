    "## Students ##\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each Student pertains to one unique student\n",
    "- Students can either be WAITLISTED or REGISTERED\n",
    "- Students can select multiple courses, but can only choose ONE course section\n",
    "- Students CANNOT retake a course they've already taken\n",
    "- Students have a certain number of credits/courses they must take\n",
    "- Some variability is required, so here is what we're going to do:\n",
    "    + We must take the ratio of the current registration list for our subset and apply it to all REGISTERED students\n",
    "    + Waitlisted students allow for an expansion of the total capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Courses ##\n",
    "- Each Course contains a certain number of WAITLISTED students\n",
    "- Each Course contains a certain number of REGISTERED students\n",
    "- It's ok if a course is MISSING REGISTERED students\n",
    "- Sections are smaller partitions of a course, but are UNIQUE\n",
    "- Courses can be a CORE or ELECTIVE course. CORE courses are listed as required.\n",
    "- Courses that ARE passed cannot be re-taken (our assumption). \n",
    "    + This is dependent on whether at ANY point in time the student takes the course again throughout the data.\n",
    "- The SIZE of the course is not known. We are trying to FIND the size by determining the AVERAGE or MEDIAN of the number of students available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sections ##\n",
    "- Each Course Section is specific to ONE course\n",
    "- ONE student can apply to ONE section\n",
    "- Each section cannot admit students who have already taken the course\n",
    "    + This can be done by reviewing the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program ##\n",
    "- Each program contains a certain number of COURSES\n",
    "- Each program has a certain influx of students that is distributed across each COURSE\n",
    "- Each program is paired with a specific semester\n",
    "- Each program can be paired based on prior semester performance\n",
    "    + Programs that are compared against prior semesters will be compared against their REGISTERED and WAITLISTED students.\n",
    "    + This extends down into COURSES.\n",
