    "The way the problem has been presented, there are basically two ways to make predictions for course demand in the future.\n",
    "1. Realistic Models\n",
    "2. Idealistic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Realistic Models** focus on the randomness in the enrollment process, which aggregates the student enrollment data and accounts for the randomness to make predictions that are as close to reality as possible.\n",
    "**Idealistic Models** on the other hand focus on the department recommendations, and graduation pathway rules to make predictions while satisfying these constraints.\n",
    "Perhaps later, a combination of these models can be employed to make predictions that is built on the Idealistic Model, but also includes variability defined by the random nature of enrollment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RbCPP (Rule-based Constrained Proportional Projectoin)** lies closer to the idealistic model to make predictions for international students and mainly the core and capstone courses. The elective courses are predicted using the probability defined from previous enrollment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules:\n",
    "1. The core courses must be registered prior to any elective courses.\n",
    "2. The capstone course which is also a core course in certain degrees, is considered as a separate category as they must be enrolled in the final semester only.\n",
    "3. Some core courses have options, students can choose to take some of the options. In such cases, the model will treat them as elective courses.\n",
    "3. Some elective courses are preferred to be enrolled in the first two semesters (elementary courses), whereas some advanced courses are preferred to be enrolled later in the semester. (Inferred form past enrollment trend.)\n",
    "4. The proportions of the weights remains relatively same throughout the semesters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms:\n",
    "1. Create and record the catalog data (core, elective and capstone courses) for each program.\n",
    "2. Create a Pathway to Graduation for International Students based on the catalog data.\n",
    "3. Get the Course Demand History for each program, course, student admit term, registration term\n",
